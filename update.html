<p>
<h2>New Version: 2.0</h2><br />
A new software version is available.
<br />
Updating Symphytum is save, all your data and files won't be deleted or altered.
<br /><br />
What's new?
<ul>
<li>New fields for web links and email addresses</li>
<li>Migration from Qt4 to Qt5 user interface toolkit</li>
<li>Bug fix: restoring a previous backup on windows no longer fails</li>
<li>Minor improvements and changes (see changelog below)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h2>WARNING: This release is not compatible with older releases because the database format changed:</h2> Updating Symphytum will automatically upgrade the old database format to the new format. Please create a backup (File->Backup) before upgrading to be on the safe side.
<br /><br />
<h2>WARNING For Linux Users:</h2> The default storage path changed due the migration from Qt4 to Qt5. Files (database and files) are no longer stored in ~/.local/share/data/giowisys/, instead they are now under ~/.local/share/giowisys/. Creating, before upgrading, and restoring a backup (File->Backup), after upgrading, allows to accomodate this change, alternatively a manual intervention to move the files is possible (copy the giowisys directory from ~/.local/share/data to ~/.local/share/).
