How It Works
------------

###The Technology

Symphytum hides the complexity of a database engine behind an easy and intuitive user interface. The underlying database is provided by the SQLite database management system, which is the leading embedded database solution, used in many mobile apps and modern computer programs, like web browsers, media players and email clients.    

SQLite is tiny, efficient and very fast. It can handle huge amount of data while being highly resistant to data corruption.      


###First Steps

1. Create a new collection.
2. Collections group your structured data together.
3. Before you begin to enter data, you need to define at least one input field.
4. Input fields have a data type (text, numeric, image...) and delineate how data is presented and inserted.
5. You can add an unlimited amount of fields.
6. The structure of a collection can be modified at any time.
7. Once the data structure is defined, you can start to add as many records as you wish.
8. Records are data entries of your collection, they can be modified, deleted and duplicated.      


Origin And License

Symphytum became open source software after the original founder company, GIOWISYS Software UG, announced its liquidation.
